# Nounish World Records

An onchain world record system that rewards record holders by indefinitely accruing a claimable amount of ETH based on an amount and time period, claimable to a receiver address - the "record holder".

Record holders and record details can be changed as records are broken.

Plans to add the ability to mint open editions for each record with potential revenue split between the holder and the treasury.

Note: I'm a total noob. Would love any experienced eyes on this and welcome any feedback.
Currently trying to get the proxy pattern working in my tests. Logic only seems to pass tests.
